## About

I work at the intersection of research and applied AI, focusing on building systems that reason, interact with tools, and remain reliable outside controlled settings.

- Experience across academic research and industry projects  
- Interests include LLM evaluation, RAG, Knowledge Graphs, and AI safety  
- Strong focus on deployability, robustness, and real-world constraints  
- Domains explored so far include Education, Biomedical AI, and Linguistics

If you are building something serious and need someone who can take it from idea to production, feel free to reach out.
